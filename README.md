 Working demo at : http://ix.pixel88.co.nz

The whole app is built with Vue.js and Bootstrap, using browser's localstorage. You can just download, unzip and run index.html, or serve with any web server or see it working at http://ix.pixel88.co.nz

BTW: Content is from Start Trek ipsum

Features:
* Search for customer title
* Sort by id, title, status, date (toggling not implemented)
* See details for each customer
* change customer's status
* Edit, add new or delete notes for each customer
* basic responsiveness
* keyboard up/down for browsing customers

**App.js** is the main app code
**Prepopulate.js** is prepopulating localstorage with some initial data.
**Styles.scss** loads bootstrap and some overriden variables, and some custom styles.

(Creating new customer is not implemented (as per spec.
There is no build, linting, module bundling, babel or tests.)
